# ðŸš€ UNI - Web Application with CI/CD Pipeline

[![CI/CD Status](https://github.com/hamdan504/UNI/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/hamdan504/UNI/actions)

> A modern university website implementation with automated deployment pipeline

## 1. Set Up Version Control

The project is already under version control and hosted on GitHub.  
**Repository URL**: `https://github.com/hamdan504/UNI.git`

## 2. Develop a Simple Web Application

Our project is a web application inspired by our university website, featuring improvements in both design and architecture.

### Here is the app running locally:

## 3. Containerize the Application

We containerized the application using Docker to ensure consistent deployment across environments.

### Docker Implementation
* **Docker Build Command**
  ```bash
  docker build -t uni-app .
  ```

* **Docker Run Command**
  ```bash
  docker run -p 3000:3000 uni-app
  ```

## 4. Set Up Continuous Integration

### Git Commit and Push: GitHub Actions Workflow Setup

Below is a sample terminal session demonstrating how we staged, committed, and pushed files to configure a CI workflow using GitHub Actions:

```bash
# Stage GitHub workflow directory
$ git add .github/

# Stage the environment file
$ git add .env.example

# Stage package.json
$ git add package.json

# Commit with a conventional commit message
$ git commit -m "ci: Add GitHub Actions workflow"
[main 74a366a] ci: Add GitHub Actions workflow
 4 files changed, 57 insertions(+), 1 deletion(-)
 create mode 100644 .env.example
 create mode 100644 .github/workflows/.env.example
 create mode 100644 .github/workflows/ci.yml

# Push changes to GitHub
$ git push origin main

## 5. Continuous Deployment

Our CD pipeline automatically deploys the application when changes are pushed to the main branch and CI checks pass.

### Deployment Process

## Infrastructure as Code with Terraform

- download from https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/install#windows
- extract and add the extracted file to path in evironment variables
- test :
