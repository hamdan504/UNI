# ğŸš€ Deploying a Web Application with a Local CI/CD Pipeline

This document outlines the process of setting up a local CI/CD pipeline for a web application project.

---

## 1. âœ… Set Up Version Control (1 hour)

The project is already under version control and hosted on GitHub.  
**Repository URL**: `https://github.com/hamdan504/UNI.git`

---

## 2. ğŸ§± Develop a Simple Web Application

Our project is a web application inspired by our university website, featuring improvements in both design and architecture.

Here is the app running locally:

## 3. ğŸ“¦ Containerize the Application

We containerized the application using Docker to ensure consistent deployment across environments.

## 4. ğŸ”„ Set Up Continuous Integration

### Git Commit and Push: GitHub Actions Workflow Setup

Below is a sample terminal session demonstrating how we staged, committed, and pushed files to configure a CI workflow using GitHub Actions:

```bash
# Stage GitHub workflow directory
$ git add .github/

# Stage the environment file
$ git add .env.example

# Stage package.json
$ git add package.json

# Commit with a conventional commit message
$ git commit -m "ci: Add GitHub Actions workflow"
[main 74a366a] ci: Add GitHub Actions workflow
 4 files changed, 57 insertions(+), 1 deletion(-)
 create mode 100644 .env.example
 create mode 100644 .github/workflows/.env.example
 create mode 100644 .github/workflows/ci.yml

# Push changes to GitHub
$ git push origin main
